## My Background
<p>I started programming when I was around 18. Growing up, I was always fascinated by technology and how it works. Primarily the internet. I am a very curious person, and love to know how things work. I began to create small applications and web pages, and that began my passion for software development. I decided to pursue computer science as more than a hobby. I switched my majors from engineering to computer science shortly after, and graduated in May of 2024 with my Bachelors in Computer Science. For now, I am working as a software developer, but plan on continuing my education in the future.</p>

<p>Nothing is more satisfying than building a working application peice by peice, and seeing it all come together.</p>
